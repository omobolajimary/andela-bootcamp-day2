# andela-bootcamp-day2
This contains the outcomes expected for day 2 of the Boot camp home study:
1. A `reverseString`function that takes in a string argument and returns the reverse of the string provided. 
If the reverse of the string is the same as the original string, as in the case of palindromes, return `true` instead.
2.A `Car` class that can be used to instantiate vehicles.
It takes in arguments that depict the *type*, *model*, and *name* of the vehicle, provided they are set.
